👨‍💻 Hi there, I'm Szymon!

📚 I'm a dedicated and curious 7th-semester student, passionate about software development and microservices architecture. My journey through the world of programming has been an exciting one, with a particular focus on .NET technologies and the C# language.

💡 I find immense joy in crafting scalable and efficient microservices using the power of .NET, and I'm constantly exploring new ways to make systems more robust, maintainable, and agile.

🚀 When I'm not buried in code, you can find me exploring the latest trends in software engineering, attending tech meetups, and working on open-source projects. My GitHub is my playground!

🌟 Here are a few things that describe me best:

💻 Proficient in .NET, C#, and microservices architecture.
📝 Love writing clean and maintainable code.
🌐 Enthusiastic about web technologies.
🧩 Always up for a coding challenge.
📫 If you share a similar passion for technology and coding, let's connect and collaborate. I'm always open to new opportunities and exciting projects!
